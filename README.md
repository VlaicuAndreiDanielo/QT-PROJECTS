# QT-Projects  

## üìå Overview  
This repository contains **six QT projects** that implement **graph algorithms while preserving Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles** and solving various computational problems. Each project provides a graphical interface for interacting with different graph-related algorithms.  

## üìù Implemented Projects  

### **1Ô∏è‚É£ Graph Drawing Interface**  
- Allows users to **draw a graph** on a graphical interface.  
- Provides an option to set the graph as **oriented or non-oriented**.  

### **2Ô∏è‚É£ BFS Algorithm for Shortest Path in a Matrix**  
- Implements **Breadth-First Search (BFS)** to find the shortest path from a start point to the exit in a matrix.  
- Displays the **graph of traversable blocks** within the matrix.  

### **3Ô∏è‚É£ Advanced Graph Algorithms**  
- Implements **Topological Sorting** using **Depth-First Search (DFS)** and modifies the graph to meet sorting constraints.  
- **Root Finding Algorithm** to determine the root of a graph.  
- **Tree Verification** to check whether a given graph is a tree.  
- **Connected Components Coloring**, where each connected component is colored differently.  
- **Strongly Connected Components (SCC) Algorithm**, displaying SCCs in a message box and randomly coloring each component.  

### **4Ô∏è‚É£ Minimum Spanning Tree Algorithms**  
- Implements **Prim's, Kruskal's, Bor≈Øvka's, and a generic algorithm** to generate a **Minimum Spanning Tree (MST)**.  
- Edge costs are entered interactively via an **input box**.  

### **5Ô∏è‚É£ Dijkstra‚Äôs Algorithm on a Scalable Map**  
- Implements **Dijkstra‚Äôs shortest path algorithm** on a **Luxembourg map**, which scales dynamically for the interface.  
- Allows users to select **two points on the map**, finding the shortest path between them.  
- If a selected point is unreachable, the closest **graph node** is used instead.  
- The shortest path is highlighted with a different color, and the **edges forming the path** are stored in a file.  

### **6Ô∏è‚É£ Maximum Flow in a Network (Ford-Fulkerson Algorithm)**  
- Implements **Ford-Fulkerson‚Äôs algorithm** to find the **maximum flow in a network**.  
- Every **5 seconds**, the residual network is displayed.  
- At the end, the **minimum cut** is highlighted in a different color.

## üöÄ Future Improvements  
- **Floyd-Warshall and Bellman-Ford algorithms** for shortest path computation.  
- **Minimum cost flow algorithm** for transporting a specified quantity in a network.  
- **Generic and fully generic traversals** for graph exploration.
